# Base

*To provide the core functions to control the DFT engine, DMFT engine, quantum impurity solvers, Kohn-Sham adaptor, self-energy engine, and mixer engine. The DFT + DMFT iteration (one-shot mode or charge fully self-consistent mode) is also implemented in this file. This file also includes some functions to watch and manipulate the IterInfo struct.*
