# Self-Energy Functions

*Tools for treating the self-energy functions ``\Sigma``, double counting terms ``\Sigma_{\text{dc}}``. Note that the function `sigma_split()` is designed for the hybridization functions ``\Delta`` and local impurity levels ``\epsilon_i``, instead of the self-energy functions.*
