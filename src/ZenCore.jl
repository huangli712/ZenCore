    Zen and ZenCore

Zen is a modern DFT + DMFT computation framework. It can be used to
study the correlated electronic structures of a wide range of strongly
correlated materials. Now this framework is under heavy development.
**PLEASE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**.

Zen supports the following DFT backends:
* `VASP`

Zen supports the following schemes for defining local orbitals:
* `PLO`
* `WANNIER`

Zen supports the following quantum impurity solvers:
* `CT-HYB`
* `HIA`
* `NORG`

ZenCore implements the core library of the Zen computation framework. It
connects various components of Zen, and drive them to work together. It
provides an easy-to-use and flexible user interface, including numerous
applications and tools.

For more details about how to obtain, install and use the Zen framework
and the ZenCore library, please visit the following website:
* `http://doc.zen`

Any suggestions, comments, and feedbacks are welcome. Enjoy it!

# Using standard libraries
#

#=
*Remarks 1*:

The TOML.jl package is included in the standard library since v1.6.
So please upgrade your julia environment if it is outdated. We need
this package to parse the configuration file (TOML format).

*Remarks 2*:

Here we import `libm` explicitly to provide a callable interface for
the `erf()` function. See `util.jl/erf()` for more details.
