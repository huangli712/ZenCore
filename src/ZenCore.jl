    Zen and ZenCore

`Zen` is a modern DFT + DMFT computation framework. It can be used to
study the correlated electronic structures of a wide range of strongly
correlated materials. Now this framework is under heavy development.
**PLEASE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**.

Zen supports the following DFT backends:

* `VASP`
* `QUANTUM ESPRESSO` (Actually only the `PWSCF` code)

Zen supports the following schemes for defining local orbitals:

* `PLO`
* `WANNIER` (Need support from the `wannier90` code)

Zen supports the following quantum impurity solvers:

* `CTHYB`
* `HIA`
* `NORG`

Zen consists of several components, including:

* `ZenCore` (Core library)
* `ZenApps` (Major applications)
* `ZenTools` (Auxiliary tools and plugins)
* `Dyson` (A dynamical mean-field theory engine)
* `iQIST` (An interacting quantum impurity solver toolkit)
* `Flink` (A reusable fortran library)

`ZenCore` implements the core library of the Zen DFT + DMFT computation
framework. It connects various components of Zen, and drive them to work
together. It provides an easy-to-use, flexible, efficient, and robust
user interface (UI) and application programming interface (API).

For more details about how to obtain, install and use the Zen framework
and the ZenCore library, please visit the following website:

* `https://huangli712.github.io/projects/zen/index.html`

Any suggestions, comments, and feedbacks are welcome. Enjoy it!

### *Using Standard Libraries*
=#

#=
*About TOML* :

The TOML.jl package is included in the standard library of julia since
v1.6. So please upgrade your julia environment if it is outdated. We
need this package to parse the configuration file (which is written in
the TOML format).

*About Distributed* :

The ZenCore runs sequentially. But it can launch the other components,
such as quantum impurity solvers, parallelly.

*About libm* :

Here we import `libm` explicitly to provide a callable interface for
the `erf()` function. Please see `util.jl/erf()` for more details. We
usually need this to calculate the electronic density of states.

### *Includes And Exports* : *sigma.jl*

#=
*Summary* :

Tools for treating the self-energy functions ``\Sigma``, double counting
terms ``\Sigma_{\text{dc}}``. Note that the function `sigma_split()` is
designed for the hybridization functions ``\Delta`` and local impurity
levels ``\epsilon_i``, instead of the self-energy functions.

*Members* :

```text
sigma_call   -> Apply various operations to self-energy functions.
sigma_reset  -> Create initial self-energy functions.
sigma_dcount -> Calculate double counting terms.
sigma_split  -> Split the hybridization functions and local impurity levels.
sigma_gather -> Gather and combine the self-energy functions.
cal_dc_fll   -> Fully localized limit scheme for double counting term.
cal_dc_amf   -> Around mean-field scheme for double counting term.
cal_dc_held  -> K. Held's scheme for double counting term.
cal_dc_exact -> Exact double counting scheme.
read_sigma   -> Read dmft1/sigma.bare file.
read_sigdc   -> Read dmft1/sigma.dc file.
write_sigma  -> Write dmft1/sigma.bare file.
write_sigdc  -> Write dmft1/sigma.dc file.

*Summary* :

Tools for mixing the self-energy functions ``\Sigma``, hybridization
functions ``\Delta``, and local impurity levels ``\epsilon_i``. They
adopted the linear mixing algorithm. We also implement the so-called
Kerker algorithm to mix the correlation-induced correction for density
matrix ``\Gamma``.

*Members* :

```text
mixer_call  -> Try to mix various functions.
mixer_sigma -> Mix self-energy functions.
mixer_delta -> Mix hybridization functions.
mixer_eimpx -> Mix local impurity levels.
mixer_gcorr -> Mix correction of density matrix Γ.
amix        -> Return the mixing parameter.
distance    -> Calculate the difference / distance between two arrays.
